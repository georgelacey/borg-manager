# borg manager
Summarises borg backups using output from 'borg create'.

My vision is to have a graphical user interface that displays a graph with data taken from a database generated from the output of borg create operations to keep track of backups. It could go anywhere though.

I intend to use it to keep track of backup duration and filesize to ensure that backups aren't taking an excessive amount of time to complete or too much storage.

I'm learning Python (and git) with this project so it might get a bit confusing at times!
