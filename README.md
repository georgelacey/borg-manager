# borg manager
Summarises borg backups using output from 'borg create'.

My aim is to have a graphical user interface that displays a graph with data taken from a database generated from the output of borg create operations to keep track of backups. It could go anywhere though.

I intend to use it to keep track of backup duration and filesize to ensure that backups aren't taking an excessive amount of time to complete or too much storage.
